# Dlang Project Euler solutions

<p align="center"><img src="logo.png"></p>

I followed the ins and outs of [DMD](https://dlang.org/) since early 2004 when the _"Great Divide"_ Phobos/Tango debate was still prevalent.

**WIP**... My _former repository_ (more than 60 Project Euler problems particularly solved in D sofar) is currently under heavy **Refactoring** and will be soon commmited here.

Meanwhile they are also ported without any further delay into [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) without delay here [pe-solution/pe-rustlang](https://github.com/pe-solutions/pe-rustlang/). Take a glimpse at them at your will ðŸ‘€

Such a great opportinity to learn with fun and without fuss the great promising language. I've made the choice to include it into my weapons of choice.
