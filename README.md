# Dlang Project Euler solutions

<p align="center"><img src="logo.png"></p>

I followed the [DMD](https://dlang.org/) since early 2004 when its tiny community was still divided by the Phobos/Tango debate.

**WIP**... My _former repository_ (more than 60 D solutions to the Project Euler sofar) is currently under heavy Refactoring and will be soon commited here.
