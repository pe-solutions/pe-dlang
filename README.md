# Dlang Project Euler solutions

<p align="center"><img src="logo.png"></p>

I followed the [DMD](https://dlang.org/) since early 2004 when its tiny community was still divided by the Phobos/Tango debate.

**WIP**... My _former repository_ (more than 60 Project Euler problems particularly solve in D sofar) is currently under heavy Refactoring and will be soon commited here.

Meanwhile they are also ported into [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) without delay here [pe-solution/pe-rustlang](https://github.com/pe-solutions/pe-rustlang/). Such a great opportinity to learn with fun and without fuss the great not to be missed language.
