[← Index](SOLUTIONS.md)

| # | Title | Approach |
|---|-------|----------|
| [101](../pe-0101/source/app.d) | Optimum Polynomial | Two approaches: finite differences (Newton forward-diff table built in-place, O(k²)) and closed-form Lagrange weights (C(k,i−1)·(−1)^(k−i) basis weights, no matrix solve) |
| [102](../pe-0102/source/app.d) | Triangle Containment | Cross-product sign test: origin inside iff all three signed areas share the same sign; CTFE-parsed coordinate file |
| [103](../pe-0103/source/app.d) | Special Subset Sums: Optimum | n=7 candidate derived from n=6 optimum {11,17,20,22,23,24}; exhaustive ±3 neighbourhood search; isSpecial checks property (ii) first (sum of k+1 smallest > sum of k largest), then all 127 subset sums distinct |
| [104](../pe-0104/source/app.d) | Pandigital Fibonacci Ends | Tail tracked mod 10⁹; leading 9 digits from fractional part of log₁₀(Fₖ) via Binet formula k·LOG_PHI−LOG_SQRT5 (avoids catastrophic cancellation of the iterative log recurrence) |
| [105](../pe-0105/source/app.d) | Special Subset Sums: Testing | Generalised isSpecial for variable-length sorted slices (7–12 elements); property-(ii) loop bound k≤(n−1)/2 from disjointness constraint |B|+|C|≤n |
| [106](../pe-0106/source/app.d) | Special Subset Sums: Meta-testing | Two approaches: standard Catalan filter C(n,2k)·(C(2k,k)/2−Catalan(k)) and ballot-sequence identity Catalan(k)=C(2k+1,k)/(2k+1); both reduce to a O(n/2)-term sum |
| [107](../pe-0107/source/app.d) | Minimal Network | Kruskal's MST on a 40-vertex adjacency matrix; union-find with path halving and union by rank; saving = total edge weight − MST weight |
| [108](../pe-0108/source/app.d) | Diophantine Reciprocals I | 1/x+1/y=1/n ⟺ (x−n)(y−n)=n²; solutions = (τ(n²)+1)/2; iterate n computing τ(n²) via trial-division factorisation until count exceeds 1000 |
| [109](../pe-0109/source/app.d) | Darts | 62 non-final dart types (S1–S20, S25, D1–D20, D25, T1–T20) + 21 finishers (doubles); 1-/2-/3-dart checkouts counted; first two darts in 3-dart are an UNORDERED pair (j≥i to avoid double-count) |
| [110](../pe-0110/source/app.d) | Diophantine Reciprocals II | Same identity; brute force infeasible — DFS over n = p1^a1·p2^a2·… (a1≥a2≥…≥1, first 15 primes) pruning n ≥ best; finds min n with τ(n²) > 7 999 999 |
| [111](../pe-0111/source/app.d) | Primes with Runs | For each digit d, enumerate 10-digit candidates with exactly nonD non-d positions (starting at nonD=1) via recursive fill; Miller-Rabin primality (witnesses {2,3,5,7,11}, deterministic ≤ 2.15·10¹²) with binary mulmod (avoids 10²⁰ overflow) |
| [112](../pe-0112/source/app.d) | Bouncy Numbers | Scan digits right-to-left: d < prev ⟹ hasUp, d > prev ⟹ hasDown; bouncy iff both; iterate n, stop when bouncy×100 = n×99 |
| [113](../pe-0113/source/app.d) | Non-bouncy Numbers | Combinatorics: n-digit increasing = C(n+8,8), decreasing = C(n+9,9)−1; hockey-stick sums to C(109,9)−1 and C(110,10)−101; subtract 9×100 repdigits counted twice |
| [114](../pe-0114/source/app.d) | Counting Block Combinations I | f(n) = ways to tile n with black (1) and red (≥3) tiles; differencing the running-sum recurrence yields f(n) = 2f(n−1)−f(n−2)+f(n−4) |
| [115](../pe-0115/source/app.d) | Counting Block Combinations II | Generalisation of #114 with minimum red length m=50; same differencing gives f(n) = 2f(n−1)−f(n−2)+f(n−m−1); find least n with f > 10⁶ |
| [116](../pe-0116/source/app.d) | Red, Green or Blue Tiles | For each colour length L ∈ {2,3,4}: g(n) = g(n−1)+g(n−L) (no separation constraint); sum g(50,L)−1 over the three colours |
| [117](../pe-0117/source/app.d) | Red, Green, and Blue Tiles | Colours may be mixed freely; f(n) = f(n−1)+f(n−2)+f(n−3)+f(n−4) (tetranacci-style recurrence) |
| [118](../pe-0118/source/app.d) | Pandigital Prime Sets | For each of 511 digit-subset masks enumerate prime-forming permutations; backtrack over all partitions of {1..9} consuming the lowest available bit first (canonical order prevents duplicate unordered sets) |
| [119](../pe-0119/source/app.d) | Digit Power Sum | Enumerate n = b^k (b ≥ 2, k ≥ 2) with digit_sum(n) = b; iterate b up to 200, powers up to 10¹⁸ with overflow guard; sort and return the 30th term |
